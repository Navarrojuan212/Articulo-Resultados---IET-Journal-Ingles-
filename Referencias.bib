   abstract = {Hybrid Polymer Optical Fiber and Visible Light Communication (POF-VLC) systems are emerging as a promising solution for high-speed, interference-free connectivity, especially in environments where traditional RF communication is constrained. This paper investigates key nonlinear impairments in POF-VLC systems, such as chromatic dispersion (CD), self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM), four-wave mixing (FWM), and stimulated scattering, which severely degrade signal quality and limit transmission range. We review advanced modulation techniques like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Discrete Multitone Modulation (DMT), alongside traditional methods like Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) and On-Off Keying (OOK), evaluating their effectiveness in overcoming these challenges. Furthermore, the application of machine learning, particularly neural network-based equalizers like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), is highlighted for their potential to enhance signal quality and system performance. This review emphasizes the transformative role these advanced strategies can play in optimizing hybrid POF-VLC systems, paving the way for their integration into high-demand communication environments. Moreover, this paper presents several promising research directions, such as optimizing training algorithms, exploring deeper neural network architectures, and integrating POF-VLC systems with emerging technologies like beyond 5G, improving energy efficiency, and addressing scalability and complexity in real-time adaptive POF-VLC systems.},

   abstract = {To overcome the limitations of visible light communication (VLC) systems while benefiting from high data rates and inherently secure transmissions, hybrid systems combining radio frequency (RF) and VLC have gained appeal for the next generation of wireless networks and their use cases, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor networks. In this article, a theoretical study is carried out to investigate the potential of hybrid systems from the security perspective by proposing a joint precoding and user association (JPUA) scheme to maximize the sum secrecy rate of a multiuser indoor downlink hybrid RF/VLC system. Specifically, it is assumed that the RF access point (AP) is equipped with multiple antennas while the VLC AP is equipped with multiple light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The optimization problem is divided into two subproblems, the user association strategy and the precoding design for each of the APs. For the former, an algorithm based on coalitional game theory is proposed to associate each user (or sensor node) with one of the APs. The latter leads to a nonconvex fractional programming problem, which is reformulated using the constrained convex-concave procedure, thus efficiently converging to an optimal solution. Numerical results based on simulations show that the proposed hybrid RF/VLC scheme provides significant gains in terms of sum secrecy rate, compared with different baseline schemes, such as standalone VLC or RF schemes, in addition to allowing the connection of a greater number of users.},

To simplify the resource allocation process of such hybrid networks, we devise a random compensation algorithm based on supermartingale theory. Firstly, a network queuing model with random arrival traffic and random compensation service mechanism are established. Then, the delay performance is evaluated based on supermartingale theory, and a tighter delay violation probability bound is derived. A search algorithm is designed to obtain the compensation bandwidth and compensation probability based on the RF. Finally, the devised algorithm is compared with that based on large deviation theory.

   abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) which realizes data transmission and universal illumination simultaneously has attracted much attention recently. However, the transmission rate of the VLC remains low due to the low bandwidth performance of LEDs and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Therefore, a hybrid approach using pulse amplitude modulation and pulse width modulation in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN) equalizer is proposed, which can theoretically increase the transmission rate by 4 times compared with the traditional way, and provide variable brightness to realize the integration of data transmission and illumination control. In addition, an artificial neural network equalizer is proposed to undo the effects of ISI, considering that the bandwidth of the LED is only 3MHz. Without the ANN equalizer, the maximum transmission rate of the proposed hybrid modulation link only reaches 36 Mbps under the condition of no signal processing; however, with the ANN equalizer, the transmission speed can up to 2.6 Gbps. The proposed system not only achieves a genuine combination of data transmission and control illumination levels, but also realizes a high data rate with less complexity},

System performance improvement employing these key technologies is also validated through experimental demonstration.

It degrades significantly the performance of uncompensated long-haul coherent optical fiber communication systems. In this work, a general expression accounting for EEPN is presented based on Gaussian noise model to evaluate the performance of multi-channel optical communication systems using EDC and digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC). The nonlinear interaction between the signal and the EEPN is analyzed. Numerical simulations are carried out in nonlinear Nyquist-spaced wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) coherent transmission systems. Significant performance degradation due to EEPN in the cases of EDC and NLC are observed, with and without the consideration of transceiver (TRx) noise. The validation of the analytical approach has been done via split-step Fourier simulations. The maximum transmission distance and the laser linewidth tolerance are also estimated to provide important insights into the impact of EEPN.},

   abstract = {Filterbank multicarrier based on offset-quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) is a promising candidate for optical fiber communication systems, thanks to its better time/frequency confinement compared to other multicarrier modulations. Among linear impairments, the compensation of fiber-induced chromatic dispersion (CD) and laser-induced phase noise (PN) in FBMC/OQAM systems induces a compromise in terms of the number of used subcarriers. Considering a fixed dedicated signal bandwidth, the number of subcarriers is expected to be large enough to allow a better frequency-domain CD compensation. On the other hand, it should be sufficiently small in order for the compensation of common phase error inherent to the PN to work properly. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the trade-off between CD and PN compensation that we previously highlighted by simulations. More specifically, considering a 20-GHz FBMC/4− −OQAM modulation and an aggregated laser linewidth of about 200 kHz, we show that the maximum transmission distance reaches 3100 km with nearly 512 active subcarriers and 3-tap equalizers, when a maximum 1-dB optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalty at a bit-error-rate (BER) of 3.8× ×10-3 can be tolerated. Moreover, we propose and validate a frame structure and an integrated synchronization/channel equalization architecture to implement a standalone demodulation system.},

   abstract = {In visible light communication (VLC) that uses direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM), the channel equalization can be done by dividing the channel gain of each subcarrier either at the receiver or the transmitter, termed as post- and pre-equalization, respectively. This paper aims to analyze the achievable rates of post- and pre-equalization in DCO-OFDM VLC. First, we theoretically reveal that the achievable rate of pre-equalization is greater than or equal to that of post-equalization within the same dynamic range, and the equality holds if and only if the VLC channel is flat. Then, we obtain the gap of achievable rate between post- and pre-equalization, which interestingly obeys the form of Kullback–Liebler (KL) divergence. We discuss the influence of the 3-dB bandwidth of VLC channel on the gap, and obtain the asymptotic gap as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical results is verified via numerical simulations. In addition, experimental measurements are conducted in our actual VLC platform to further verify the theoretical results. The measurement results approximately match with the simulation results.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between noise and bandwidth in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In the past few years, pre-emphasis and post-equalization techniques were proposed to extend the bandwidth of VLC systems. However, these bandwidth extension techniques also influence noise and sensitivity of the VLC systems. In this paper, first, we build a system model of VLC transceivers and circuit models of pre-emphasis and post-equalization. Next, we theoretically compare the bandwidth and noise of three different transceiver structures comprising a single pre-emphasis circuit, a single post-equalization circuit and a combination of pre-emphasis and post-equalization circuits. Finally, we validate the presented theoretical analysis using experimental results. The result shows that for the same resonant frequency, and for high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), VLC systems employing post-equalization or pre-emphasis have the same bandwidth extension ability. Therefore, a transceiver employing both the pre-emphasis and post-equalization techniques has a bandwidth √2 times the bandwidth of the systems employing only the pre-emphasis or post-equalization. Based on the theoretical analysis of noise, the VLC system with only active pre-emphasis shows the lowest noise, which is a good choice for low-noise systems. The result of this paper may provide a new perspective of noise and sensitivity of the bandwidth extension techniques in VLC systems.},

   abstract = {The range of transmitters, detectors and other components that can be used in optical wireless links means that they can have a wide variety of frequency responses. Both pre- and post- equalization have been used in optical wireless systems to increase data rates. Pre-equalization has the advantage that noise impairments due to equalization can be minimised. However, the variety of pre-equalizer transfer functions, which can be easily created using analog circuits, is limited by the frequency responses of these circuits. Consequently, it may not be possible to equalize some optical wireless links with analog circuit-based pre-equalizers. In this paper a flexible digital pre-equalization scheme that can equalize complex frequency responses is described. The flexibility and the applicability of the scheme is also demonstrated using two example systems, including one that incorporates a fluorescent optical fiber to create a wide-field-of-view receiver for handheld devices. In particular, the bandwidths of the two example systems have been increased to over 500 MHz and to 350 MHz, resulting in at least a three-fold increase in data rate without any post-equalization. The authors believe that this is the first time such significant improvements in on-off-keying data rates have been demonstrated in systems with a relatively complex frequency response and a limited dynamic range.},

   abstract = {Visible Light Communications (VLC) have gained much popularity lately. In such a system, a white LED (Light-Emitting Diode) plays a double role as a light source and a transmitter. The main problem here is that the LED exhibits a low bandwidth and high nonlinearity, so the equalization of the LED nonlinear dynamic response is necessary. For this, various equalizers are used. This paper compares the pre-and post-equalizer performance in terms of the received signal quality for a channel that includes a nonlinear element of limited bandwidth, such as an LED. Multilevel Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) was selected as the signal format, as well as a variant of the Volterra series equalizer as the compensating element. The results obtained may be used for the correction of the dynamic characteristics of LEDs applied in VLC systems. For the sake of comparison, we used Modulation Error Ratio (MER) values at the receiver output. The dynamic nonlinear behavior was modeled by a Wiener–Hammerstein device, whereas the post/pre-equalizer was based on the dynamic deviation reduction-based Volterra series. The obtained results indicate that the post-and pre-equalizer performed comparably for the linear/moderately nonlinear channels and for a high noise level. In the case of high nonlinearity and a large SNR (Signal–to–Noise Ratio) values, the post-equalizer performed somewhat better in terms of MER by a few dB at maximum.},

   abstract = {A joint pre‐ and post‐equalization scheme is proposed for an optical intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) system. At the transmitter, a linear feed‐forward pre‐equalizer with just two, three, or four filter taps is suggested to limit the transmitter's complexity and to allow the use of multi‐level modulation. Finally, this concept is combined with a zero‐forcing post‐equalizer at the receiver. By utilizing numerical optimization to design the multi‐level signals, the intersymbol‐interference originating from the channel is mitigated pre‐equalizer taps, a reduction of 3\% in received power compared to a conventional zero‐forcing design is achieved. The equalization scheme is tailored for an optical IM/DD system. Therefore, the specific power constraints of such a setup are taken into account in the equalizer design process. In contrast to existing research, the approach is tested for a multi‐mode fiber system, which is affected by increased inter‐symbol interference due to modal dispersion. The simulation results show that by shifting a small portion of the equalization complexity to the transmitter side, the required optical power to reach a bit‐error rate of is reduced by 7.3\% for zero‐forcing and 6.8\% for minimum mean square error post‐equalizers. the noise increase by the post‐equalizer is reduced by 6.9\% when including the pre‐equalizer with just two filter taps. Compared to an equalization scheme that solely relies on a zero‐forcing post‐equalizer, the suggested joint pre‐ and post‐equalization scheme is able to improve the bit‐error rate performance by an average of 7.15\%. A testbed experiment with a 250m multi‐mode fiber channel and a data rate of 2.5Gbps operating at 1550nm confirms these simulation results.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time of employing polarization-multiplexing to achieve a high VLC transmission capacity by using phosphor-based white-LED without optical blue filter. Besides, utilizing the optimum resistor-inductor-capacity (RLC) bias-tee design, it can not only perform the function of combining the direct-current (DC) and the electrical data signal, but also act as a simple LED-Tx circuit. No optical blue filter and complicated post-equalization are required at the Rx.

However, due to the limitations of VLC such as finite coverage and inconvenient uplinks, it is imperative to form the hybrid systems and realize the complementary advantages of VLC and RF. In this paper, the hybrid VLC-RF system with multi-users is investigated, where the sum achievable rate and energy efficiency (EE) are maximized via the alternate optimization of transceiver association and power allocation. In addition, based on various types of multiple access points, EE is optimized under different QoS requirements for green communications. With the assistance of proper approximations, the overall problem is decomposed into several convex sub-problems, which can be solved analytically and avoid traversal permutation. The numerical simulations show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm in the hybrid VLC-RF system, which can achieve superior performances than the conventional methods and single systems in multifarious scenarios.},

The integration between systems based on radio frequency (RF) and visible light communication (VLC) promises the design of hybrid systems capable of addressing and largely satisfying these requirements. Hybrid network design enables complementary cooperation without interference between the two technologies, thereby increasing the overall system data rate, improving load balancing, and reducing non-coverage areas. VLC/RF hybrid networks can offer reliable and efficient communication solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart lighting, location-based services, home automation, smart healthcare, and industrial IoT. Therefore, hybrid VLC/RF networks are key technologies for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, a comprehensive state-of-the-art study of hybrid VLC/RF networks is carried out, divided into four areas. First, indoor scenarios are studied considering lighting requirements, hybrid channel models, load balancing, resource allocation, and hybrid network topologies. Second, the characteristics and implementation of these hybrid networks in outdoor scenarios with adverse conditions are analyzed. Third, we address the main applications of hybrid VLC/RF networks in technological, economic, and socio-environmental domains. Finally, we outline the main challenges and future research lines of hybrid VLC/RF networks.},

The white light color accuracy required in the general illumination market is a challenge for LEDs. The variation in lumen output and wavelength for nominally identical LEDs and the change in these parameters with temperature and time result in an unacceptably high variability in the color point of white light from RGB-LEDs. In this paper, we show that these problems can be overcome with suitable feedback control schemes that can be implemented in a practical LED lamp. We present results of experiment and theoretical modeling that shows the performance that can be achieved with a number of different control schemes.},

Here, we demonstrated the RGB InGaN micro-LEDs, and investigated the effects of temperature and current density for the InGaN RGB micro-LED display. We found that temperature increase can lead to the changes of electrical characteristics, the shifts in electroluminescence spectra, the increase of full width at half maximum and the decreases of light output power, external quantum efficiency, power efficiency, and ambient contrast ratios, while current density increase can also give rise to different changing trends of the varieties of parameters mentioned just above for the RGB micro-LED display, creating great challenges for its application in practical scenarios. Despite of the varying electrical and optical charateristics, relatively high and stable colour gamut of the RGB display can be maintained under changing temperature and current density. Based on the results above, mechanisms on the temperature and current density effects were analyzed in detail, which would be helpful to predict the parameters change of micro-LED display caused by temperature and current density, and provided guidance for improving the performance of InGaN micro-LED display in the future.},

Solid-state lighting with these LEDs is transforming patterns of energy usage and lifestyle throughout the world. With solid-state lighting gradually taking over from incandescent and fluorescent lighting, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are very much the focus of research nowadays. This compact review takes a look at LEDs for lighting applications made from wide band gap semiconductors. A very brief history of electric lighting is included for completeness, followed by a description of blue-emitting LEDs that serve as pump sources for all ‘white’ LEDs. This is followed by a discussion on techniques to extract more light from the confines of LED chips through surface patterning. The thermal management of LEDs is perhaps the most important consideration in designing and using LED-based luminaires. This topic is discussed with regard to recent studies on LED reliability. The very promising development of gallium nitride-on-silicon LEDs is examined next followed by a discussion on phosphors for color conversion in LEDs. LED lighting has positively influenced both upscale and downscale illumination markets worldwide. Its societal impact is examined, with the review concluding with a look at efforts to produce LEDs from zinc oxide–a material that holds much promise for the future of solid-state lighting.},

This indicates that accurate measurement of LED temperature is of great importance to better understand the thermal effects over a system and improve performance. Over the years, various Tj measurement techniques have been developed, and existing methods have been improved in many ways with technological and scientific advancements. Correspondingly, in order to address the governing phenomena, benefits, drawbacks, possibilities, and applications, a wide range of measurement techniques and systems are covered. This paper comprises a large number of published studies on junction temperature measurement approaches for LEDs, and a summary of the experimental parameters employed in the literature are given as a reference. In addition, some of the corrections noted in non-ideal thermal calibration processes are discussed and presented.

The typical studied LED exhibits a smaller 3 dB bandwidth (0.6 MHz versus 2 MHz) compared with a reference LED with ultra-violet/blue MQWs and a yellow phosphor coating. This finding suggests that the fluorescent decay time of red phosphor is much longer than that of yellow ones (approximately 270 ns versus approximately 80 ns). In addition, the extracted carrier lifetime inside blue/green InxGa1-xN/GaN MQWs under UV light pumping/modulation is as long as approximately 50 ns, which is much slower than that of forward-biased current modulation (approximately 50 ns versus <10 ns). A bandpass UV filter is installed in the receiver side to exclude these slow fluorescent times in MQWs and phosphor.

LED chip peaked near 400 nm is the most efficient among the NUV chips currently. However, most of blue phosphors show inefficient excitation around 400 nm. Herein, a novel blue phosphor SrLu2O4:Ce3+ matching well with near 400 nm chip and showing high thermal stability has been developed. The photoluminescence spectrum presents a broad emission band peaking at 460 nm with a bandwidth of nearly 90 nm. By optimizing the Ce3+ concentration, an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) as high as 76\% was achieved. Furthermore, 86\% of the room-temperature emission intensity is still maintained at 150 °C, indicating a good thermal stability and practicality. A series of white LEDs were fabricated based on 405 nm chips coated with a blend of the new blue phosphor with the commercial yellow and red phosphors. High color rendering indexes (≥90) were achieved while the correlated color temperature was tuneable in the range of 3094 to 8990 K.

   abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for high data-rate applications and the proliferation of connected devices pose several theoretical and technological challenges for the fifth generation (5G) networks and beyond. Among others, this includes the spectrum scarcity and massive connectivity of devices, particularly in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. In this respect, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a potential solution for these challenges, particularly in scenarios relating to indoor communications. Additionally, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for VLC has been envisioned to address some of the key challenges in the next generation wireless networks. However, in realistic environments, it has been shown that VLC systems suffer from additive optical interference due to ambient light, and user-mobility which cause detrimental outages and overall degraded data rates. Motivated by this, in this work, we first derive the statistics of the incurred additive interference, and then analyze the rate of the considered NOMA-VLC channel. An analytical expression is subsequently derived for the rate of NOMA-VLC systems with ambient light and user-mobility, followed by the formulation of a power-allocation technique for the underlying scenario, which has been shown to outperform classical gain-ratio power allocation in terms of achievable rate. The obtained analytical results are corroborated with computer simulations for various realistic VLC scenarios of interest, which lead to useful insights of theoretical and practical interest. For example, it is shown that, in a NOMA-enabled VLC system, the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a static VLC communication channel with ambient light asymptotically converges to the Shannon Hartley capacity formula.},

   abstract = {Communications based solely on radio frequency (RF) networks cannot provide adequate quality of service for the rapidly growing demands of wireless connectivity. Since devices operating in the optical spectrum do not interfere with those using the RF spectrum, wireless networks based on the optical spectrum can be added to existing RF networks to fulfill this demand. Hence, optical wireless communication (OWC) technology can be an excellent complement to RF-based technology to provide improved service. Promising OWC systems include light fidelity (LiFi), visible light communication, optical camera communication (OCC), and free-space optical communication (FSOC). OWC and RF systems have differing limitations, and the integration of RF and optical wireless networks can overcome the limitations of both systems. This paper describes an LiFi/femtocell hybrid network system for indoor environments. Low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios and the shortage bandwidth problems of existing RF femtocell networks can be overcome with the proposed hybrid model. Moreover, we describe an integrated RF/optical wireless system that can be employed for users inside a vehicle, remote monitoring of ambulance patients, vehicle tracking, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. We consider LiFi, OCC, and FSOC as the optical wireless technologies to be used for communication support in transportation, and assume macrocells, femtocells, and wireless fidelity to be the corresponding RF technologies. We describe handover management—including detailed call flow, interference management, link reliability improvement, and group handover provisioning—for integrated networks. Performance analyses demonstrate the significance of the proposed integrated RF/optical wireless systems.},

   abstract = {Cochannel interference in indoor wireless communication systems can severely limit system capacity and performance. To reduce cochannel interference in indoor environments, electromagnetic shielding can be used to increase the radio isolation between physically adjacent systems. In this paper, the impact of structural (wall) shielding on the system performance of an interference-limited CDMA system is examined using a ray-tracing propagation model. A logarithmic relationship is observed between the average outage probability and the extent of shielding in a typical single-floor office environment. With an efficient deployment of shielding, the results obtained suggest that both the capacity and signal quality of a wireless system can be enhanced as the number of base stations increases. By incorporating shielding into the architecture of a building, wireless-friendly environments that facilitate better use of the available radio spectrum might be realized.

   abstract = {The radio frequency (RF) spectrum becomes overly crowded in some indoor environments due to the high density of users and bandwidth demands. To accommodate the tremendous wireless data demands, efficient spectrum-sharing approaches are highly desired. To this end, this paper introduces a new spectrum sharing solution for indoor environments based on the usage of a reconfigurable reflect-array in the middle of the wireless channel. By optimally controlling the phase shift of each element on the reflect-array, the useful signals for each transmission pair can be enhanced while the interferences can be canceled. As a result, multiple wireless users in the same room can access the same spectrum band at the same time without interfering each other. Hence, the network capacity can be dramatically increased. To prove the feasibility of the proposed solution, an experimental testbed is first developed and evaluated. Then, the effects of the reflect-array on transport capacity of the indoor wireless networks are investigated. Through experiments, theoretical deduction, and simulations, this paper demonstrates that significantly higher spectrum-spatial efficiency can be achieved by using the smart reflect-array without any modification of the hardware and software in the users' devices.},

In this paper, we explore the capacity and energy efficiency for femtocell network by developing a TV white spaces reuse and power allocation scheme. The problem is formulated into an optimization problem with the objective to maximize the energy efficiency achieved by a femtocell network, while keeping the interference to the primary receiver and macro receiver at an acceptable level. We demonstrate the existence of a unique globally optimal transmit power vector for all the femtocells, and propose a gradient absent algorithm to obtain it.

However, the rapidly dwindling RF spectrum along with increasing wireless network traffic has substantiated the need for greater bandwidth and spectral relief. By combining illumination and communication, VLC provides ubiquitous communication while addressing the shortfalls and limitations of RF communication. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on VLC with an emphasis on challenges faced in indoor applications over the period 1979-2014. VLC is compared with infrared (IR) and RF systems and the necessity for using this beneficial technology in communication systems is justified. The advantages of LEDs compared to traditional lighting technologies are discussed and comparison is done between different types of LEDs currently available. Modulation schemes and dimming techniques for indoor VLC are discussed in detail. Methods needed to improve VLC system performance such as filtering, equalization, compensation, and beamforming are also presented. The recent progress made by various research groups in this field is discussed along with the possible applications of this technology.

The cognitive Radio-enabled IoT (CR-IoT) is proposed as an effective method for spectrum resource allocation and risk monitoring in the IoT. The signal detection and modulation recognition are the key technologies for CR-IoT, addressing the problem of multisignal detection and automatic modulation classification (AMC) is one of the prerequisites for realizing secure dynamic spectrum access. Based on sliding window and deep learning (DL), this study proposes a multisignal frequency domain detection and recognition method. The frequency spectrum of the time-domain overlapping signal is obtained through the fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the frequency spectrum is segmented based on the signal energy detection method. Finally a complex convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed for the identification of signal spectrum information. The proposed method can recognize 264 time-domain aliasing and frequency-closed signals with an accuracy of 97.3\% under the influence of -2 dB corresponding to the noise of the calibration signal. In addition, the proposed method eliminates the influence of bandwidth, which can effectively detect and recognize the signal types of each component in the frequency band. This method has wide applicability and provides an effective scheme for the IoT cognitive technology.},

As one of the methods for efficiently using the spectrum, it is necessary to check the margin of the 4G spectrum. This is because unused resources of 4G spectrum can be reused as resources for 5G. For this, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate4G network saturation and spectrum availability. In this paper, we present a methodology to analyze and evaluate the saturation and spectrum availability of a 4G LTE network using spectrum utilization and traffic volumes with simultaneously measured data during congestion at a co-site in Gangnam, Seoul, a traffic dense area.

   abstract = {I n the October 2020 issue of IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine, we are pleased to present a special issue on "Spectrum and Energy Efficient Wireless Communications" with a collection of 12 articles. In this issue, we are also very glad to present 12 articles accepted from the open call. Driven by new-generation mobile devices and bandwidth consuming applications such as video streaming, wireless traffic volume is expected to continue expanding tremendously in the next few years. Sustaining this growing trend will in turn require higher spectrum capacity from the network side. Research has shown that capacity demand increases much faster than the current spectrum efficiency improvement, in particular at hot spot areas. From recent data, global mobile data traffic increased nearly 11-fold in the last few years. In contrast, the peak data rate from 3G wireless technology to 4G wireless technology only increased 55 percent in the last decade. Clearly there is a huge gap between the capacity growth of new wireless access technologies and the fast growth of wireless traffic volume for the next-generation wireless networks. In the meantime, energy efficiency, commonly defined as information bits per unit of energy, has become another essential requirement for the design of future wireless communication networks besides spectrum efficiency. Energy efficient communications have attracted great attention due to the ever-increasing demand to preserve energy resources and to protect the environment. Furthermore, mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, are widely used to conduct new applications such as video content distribution, location-aware advertisement , video chatting, video streaming, music and movie downloading, etc. In the year 2012, mobile video traffic exceeded 50 percent of the total wireless traffic volume for the first time. Mobile video has increased 14-fold since then, accounting for 69 percent of the total mobile data traffic by the end of last year. How to support energy and bandwidth consuming video applications with high QoE is becoming another challenging issue in future wireless networks. Clearly, there is an urgency for a new disruptive paradigm to bridge the gap between the increasing capacity, energy and QoE demands and the deficiency of radio spectrum resources. As wireless channel efficiency is approaching its fundamental limit, improvements in future wireless system capacity can be alternatively realized by networking technologies such as node density increase through underlay and overlay deployments, or by going to a higher spectrum such as millimeter wave to seek more spectrum bandwidth. In addition to delivering the required network spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency and QoE, the anticipated tremendous proliferation of machine-type devices and consumer-wearable devices also makes the underlay wireless network desirable. These small devices usually have limited onboard processing power and battery size. If they need powerful computing capability to process extensive content information, they will have to heavily rely on their surrounding local networks and computing platforms to facilitate these computing-intensive and thus power consuming applications. Using high performance and very low laten-cy communication links to offload mobile device computing load into nearby powerful computing clouds becomes an essential direction to pursue. This paradigm shift in the next decade also calls for the cluster-based underlay networking technologies , in which a cluster head of a number of underlay devices can be selected as the representative of the entire cluster for both communication and control purposes. Spectrum and energy efficient wireless communications is one of the most important topics today in the next generation wireless networking area, and attracting more and more attention from industry, research, and academia. This special issue focuses on the challenges and novel solutions for spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication networks. Thanks to the guest editors, Q. Liang, T. S. Durrani, J. Koh, Q. Wu, and X. Wang, who did an excellent job in editing this special issue for our readers. Please stay tuned for new developments in the research area of spectrum and energy efficient wireless communications, and read the editorial for more details about the papers in this special issue. In addition to the 12 articles in the special issue, we have also included 12 accepted open call articles. The first article, "Dense Small Satellite Networks for Modern Terrestrial Communication Systems: Benefits, Infrastructure, and Technologies" by N. Hassan et al., demonstrates several components of dense small satellite networks (DSSN) infrastructure , including satellite formations, orbital paths, inter-satellite communication links, and communication architectures for data delivery from source to destination. It also reviews important technologies for DSSN as well as the challenges involved in the use of these technologies in DSSN. Several open research directions to enhance the benefits of DSSN for MTCS are also identified in the article. A case study showing the integration benefits of DSSN in mobile terrestrial communication systems is also included. The second article, "Overcoming the Channel Estimation Barrier in Massive MIMO Communication via Deep Learning" by Z. Liu et al., discusses the application of deep learning (DL) for massive MIMO channel estimation in wireless networks by integrating the underlying characteristics of channels in future high-speed cellular deployment. It develops important insights derived from the physical radio frequency channel properties and presents a comprehensive overview on the application of DL for accurately estimating channel state information (CSI) with low overhead. The article provides examples of successful DL application in CSI estimation for massive MIMO wireless systems and highlights several promising directions for future research. In the third article, "Energy-aware Task Offloading in Inter-net of Things", J. Li et al. introduce a new energy-aware task offloading scheme in IoT to determine the optimal offloading strategy. First, they investigate the architecture of mobile edge computing (MEC) in IoT. Second, they discuss the challenges of task offloading in MEC for IoT. Third, they propose the framework of task offloading for MEC, the optimal offloading strategy for computing task is achieved. Finally, the article demonstrates experiment results to show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the efficiency of task offloading compared with the conventional scheme.},

   abstract = {With the development of wireless communication technology, the need for bandwidth is increasing continuously, and the growing need makes wireless spectrum resources more and more scarce. Cognitive radio (CR) has been identified as a promising solution for the spectrum scarcity, and its core idea is the dynamic spectrum access. It can dynamically utilize the idle spectrum without affecting the rights of primary users, so that multiple services or users can share a part of the spectrum, thus achieving the goal of avoiding the high cost of spectrum resetting and improving the utilization of spectrum resources. In order to meet the critical requirements of the fifth generation (5G) mobile network, especially the Wider-Coverage, Massive-Capacity, Massive-Connectivity, and Low-Latency four application scenarios, the spectrum range used in 5G will be further expanded into the full spectrum era, possibly from 1 GHz to 100 GHz. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of CR technology and focus on the current significant research progress in the full spectrum sharing towards the four scenarios. In addition, the key enabling technologies that may be closely related to the study of 5G in the near future are presented in terms of full-duplex spectrum sensing, spectrum-database based spectrum sensing, auction based spectrum allocation, carrier aggregation based spectrum access. Subsequently, other issues that play a positive role for the development research and practical application of CR, such as common control channel, energy harvesting, non-orthogonal multiple access, and CR based aeronautical communication are discussed. The comprehensive overview provided by this survey is expected to help researchers develop CR technology in the field of 5G further.},

   abstract = {This paper tracks increasingly aggressive initiatives by the United States government to reallocate spectrum on an expedited and unilateral basis well before conclusion of inter-governmental coordination. Rather than embrace the customary commitment to achieve consensus on global spectrum allocations at the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has auctioned off large blocks of frequencies for the next generation (“5G”) of wireless services. The FCC might have framed its first 5G auction, reassigning Ultra High Frequency (“UHF”) spectrum, as a one-time deviation from compliance with long standing, intergovernmental coordination procedures. These frequencies have ideal signal propagation characteristics and the Commission could use financial incentives—unavailable in most nations—to expedite “repacking” by incumbent broadcasters willing to move, share or abandon spectrum in exchange for ample financial compensation. However, the FCC has continued to auction off 5G spectrum on grounds that it must find ways to abate an acute shortage of wireless bandwidth and doing so will regain or maintain global leadership in wireless technologies. This paper offers a critical rebuke to unilateral spectrum management, because the short-term benefits expected by the U. S. government likely will be offset by countervailing harms to 5G manufacturers, carriers and consumers. The paper tracks fractious preparation for the ITU's 2019 World Radio Conference by the U.S. delegation and the mixed record achieved there. Additionally, the paper explains how injecting trade, industrial policy and national security issues at the ITU can trigger more delays and disputes, including possible retaliation by nations displeased with U.S. efforts to subvert traditional technology optimization goals. A worst case scenario has the ITU deadlocked and unable to reach closure on “mission critical” spectrum planning issues at World Radio Conferences, convened every four years. The paper concludes that costs and likely challenges to the efficacy and legitimacy of the ITU will reduce the benefits accruing from the FCC's unilateral, spectrum planning campaign.},

   abstract = {WiFi 6 based on the IEEE 802.11ax amendment is intended to improve spectral efficiency and area throughput operations in high density environments. This is achieved (among other methods) by the introduction of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and enhanced multi-user Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) features. In this work, we explore the performance of downlink and uplink OFDMA in 802.11ax via extensive simulation based evaluation (latency, throughput, range) compared to conventional single user (SU) transmissions. Based on our results, we conclude that OFDMA can reduce the median latency from ∼5 ms to less than 1 ms in non-saturation conditions. When used in conjunction with efficient multi-user buffer status report and restricted EDCA mechanisms, OFDMA can increase the saturation throughput by more than 10 percent. Moreover, UL OFDMA also improves aggregate throughput at longer ranges due to the narrower sub-channels (equivalently increased transmit power spectral density); four stations achieve an aggregate throughput 35 percent higher than a station transmitting SU frames and located at a range 1.5 times closer to the access point.},

   abstract = {There have been substantial technical and policy discussions about the spectrum needs of 5G and the necessity of expanding access to higher frequency spectrum, including in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands from 30 to 300 GHz. The focus, however, has been on bands below 60GHz, or at most 90GHz, which is the current limit of near-future commercial technologies. As wireless markets continue to grow, demand may arise for spectrum in still higher frequency bands above 90GHz, including in the sub-millimeter or Terahertz (THz) bands between 300GHz and 3THz. Although exploiting THz bands is at the frontiers of technical research today and the commercial case for it will depend on further demonstration of the value and constraints, it is worthwhile exploring how THz spectrum might impact wireless network architectures, business/usage cases, and spectrum policy. In this paper, we explore those challenges. We first explain some of the critical features of THz spectrum that make it both attractive and challenging to use and summarize the current state of our ability to address those challenges by reference to the current engineering research and commercialization progress on exploiting mmWave and higher frequencies. For example, the THz spectrum would offer virtually unbounded capacity (relative to today's demand forecasts) for supporting wide-channels and extremely high data rates, but with demanding Line of Sight (LOS) requirements. THz devices operate in very narrow beams, close to optical wavelengths, and have very limited capability to penetrate materials (e.g., even a sheet of paper is sufficient to block it). Integrating such spectrum into wireless networks will impose important requirements for antenna siting (small cell architectures) and backhaul, posing greater challenges for extending core-network services to edge-networks. We hypothesize that such spectrum may further empower equipment-based, end-user deployed strategies for deploying wireless networking, with interesting implications for industry structure and regulatory policy. Furthermore, because current spectrum policies are limited to radio frequencies below 300GHz (arguably below 90GHz), THz is the green-field frontier for spectrum policy-making. This offers an opportunity for novel thinking about how best to manage spectrum resources to enable efficient sharing. Moreover, shifting wireless services to THz might free up capacity in the currently scarce lower frequency bands (below 10GHz), with implications for how we should think about spectrum management across all frequency bands. This includes addressing the challenge of the appropriate licensing regime (e.g., exclusive or unlicensed) that should apply 1},

   abstract = {In this study, we report the successful demonstration of an intermediate-frequency-over-fiber (IFoF)-based radio access network (RAN) for 28 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based 5G mobile communication. In order to increase the network coverage of the mmWave-based 5G networks, we propose a distributed antenna system (DAS) that uses the IFoF technology. An IFoF-based DAS with 2 × 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration was deployed in the PyeongChang area to provide 5G trial demonstration during the Winter Olympics. 5G trial services such as high-speed data transfer and autonomous vehicle driving were offered to the public through the IFoF-based DAS. A downlink throughput of ∼1 Gb/s and uplink throughput of ∼200 Mb/s were achieved in the DAS-deployed area. We also present an IFoF-based 5G mobile fronthaul that can overcome the bandwidth bottleneck in RANs. We performed real-time transmission of mmWave-based 5G wireless access networks using the IFoF-based mobile fronthaul. The real-time downlink throughput achieved per 5G terminal was approximately 9 Gb/s, when using a 4 × 4 MIMO configuration. An outdoor demonstration was performed to verify the technical feasibility of the 5G fronthaul based on IFoF technology. When moving the 5G terminal between remote radio heads at a speed less than 60 km/h, 5G mobile broadband services could be provided with real-time throughput more than 5 Gb/s. Thus, we confirmed that the IFoF technology was capable of supporting RANs for mmWave-based 5G networks and providing real-time multi-Gb mobile services.},

   abstract = {Satisfying the exponential data growth is one of the main challenges for the design of future wireless networks. Given the abundant spectrum availability at millimeter-wave bands, exploiting these frequencies is a natural choice. WiGig (also known as 60 GHz WiFi) allows multi-gigabit transmissions in short range wireless links. The maximum data transfer rates occur in line of sight (LOS) connections. Given the small operating wavelength, obstructing the LOS causes significant power losses, severely impacting the attainable throughput of each user. This article presents empirical results to parameterize typical small-scale fades caused by pedestrians when blocking the LOS, in areas where a WiGig access point serves indoor users. Our results show that fades can be as large as 21 dB, in average. Furthermore, burst of fades are common, lasting up to 5200 ms in 90\% of the observed cases.},

However, efficient coexistence is particularly challenging because the operating in the 60 GHz is usually deployed with a dense small-cell setting for indoor application and it is hard to avoid interference. In this study, we propose an efficient spectrum coexistence mechanism for NR-U and WiGig to improve spectrum availability and ensure fair coexistence. We also analyze the effect of duty cycle time fraction on NR-U and WiGig networks. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm maximizes the overall throughput of the NR-U network by joint spectrum resource and transmission power allocation.

To accomplish a VLC system, receiver antennas play a crucial role in receiving light signals and guiding them toward a photodetector to be converted into electrical signals. This paper demonstrates an optical receiver antenna based on luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) technology to exceed the conservation of etendue and reach a high signal-to-noise ratio. This optical antenna is compatible with all colors of LEDs and achieves an optical efficiency of 3.75\%, which is considerably higher than the similar reported antenna. This antenna is fast due to the small attached photodetector—small enough that it can be adapted for electronic devices—which does not need any tracking system. Moreover, numerical simulation is performed using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, and results are extracted in the spectral domain. Finally, the fate of each photon and the chromaticity diagram of the collected photons’ spectra are specified.},

However, the power consumption of a VLC link due to incoherent transmission is a major concern for system designers. Only a few studies have addressed this issue. In this paper, a theoretical study on the relationship between the power consumption and the data rate of a high speed VLC link is presented. The considered VLC link is based on direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO - OFDM) and on-off keying (OOK).

Our proposed systems are examined with three different receivers: a wide-field of view (W-FOV) receiver, an angle diversity receiver (ADR) and an imaging diversity receiver (IMDR). A novel algorithm is introduced also to eliminate the multi-user interference that is caused by line of sight (LOS) components, since these have a great impact on VLC systems performance. The effect of multi-user interference, mobility and diffuse reflections are considered in this work. We also investigate the effect of an increase in the number of the users on our proposed systems while achieving a high data rate for each user. Our proposed systems achieve 1 Gb/s for ADT with W-FOV receiver, 2 Gb/s for ADT with ADR and 4 Gb/s for ADT with IMDR with a simple modulation technique (on–off-keying, OOK).},

   abstract = {A high-power light-emitting diode (LED) panel-lamp connected in series with a low-complexity modulation circuit using metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is proposed for an indoor visible-light communication system. The MOSFET modulation circuit consists of a high-speed MOSFET and a shunt resistor, in which the MOSFET gives a variable load driven by the data bit stream and the shunt resistor can tune the modulation depth of the transmitter. In addition, only focusing optical lens is employed in the receiver but no collimation optical lens is adopted in the transmitter to increase the working area. Although the largest data rate is limited to 2 Mbps, the longitudinal communication distances is as long as 6 m; moreover, the maximum horizontal distance is up to 5 m (~ 78.5 m2 in area) along with 3 m in longitudinal distance at the data rates of 1 Mbps. Compared with the traditional Bias-Tee configuration, the proposed MOSFET configuration leads to a lower data rate but a higher modulation depth as well as much larger working area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest working area at such a high data rate with on–off-keying using a single LED luminary without collimation optical lens. The system has the inherent ability to realize pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). The 4-PAM is demonstrated to double the data rates.},

Unfortunately, the issues of crosstalk, interference, or data leakage in the VLC impose rigorous requests for the receiver terminal, photodetector, including fast and accurate signal recognition, rapid decoding, etc. In pursuit of distinctive merits, a dual-band photodetector is proposed as an efficient receiver terminal for VLC in this work. With MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 as photoactive layers, a device by stacking two photodiodes in opposite polarity is constructed to sense the signals at two different wavelengths from a commercial white light-emitting diode (LED) transmitter. By manipulating the applied bias direction, the response of a single device can be controllably switched between 300−570 and 630−800 nm with an optical crosstalk of less than −30 dB. The performance with an Ion/Ioff ratio of about 108, a response bandwidth (f−3dB) of ∼33 kHz, a response switching rate approaching 1000 Hz, and a detectivity of 1.75 × 1010 Jones ensures its application as an efficient data receiver.

Indoor VLC scenarios commonly consist of multiple users in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In NLOS, the light waves suffer from attenuation due to diffuse reflection from obstacles in the room, leading to significant attenuation in light intensity. This paper proposes a wavefront shaping method to enhance indoor VLC for multiple users, including both LOS and NLOS. By employing a spatial division scheme, we can simultaneously achieve a light intensity gain of 5.43 dB in NLOS through stepwise partitioning wavefront shaping and an opening angle range of 27° for two LOS users through computational holography. By employing bit-power-loading discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation, we demonstrated VLC with transmission data rates of 3.082 Gbit/s and 3.052 Gbit/s for two LOS links and 2.235 Gbit/s for NLOS with 30.7\% improvement compared with that without wavefront shaping, satisfying the 7\% forward-error-correction (FEC) threshold.},

Interference by ambient light sources is among the most critical challenges. Owing to the wideband VLC spectrum, the efficiency of wavelength-dependent optical filtering is limited, especially in the presence of sunlight. Multi-user VLC causes additional interference, since LEDs are characterized by a wide viewing angle. Although algorithm-based interference suppression is a feasible method, receiver saturation and especially noise enhancement are two challenges that can only by addressed effectively by filtering in the optical domain prior to the photodetector. In this publication, we propose the use of a liquid-crystal display (LCD) as receiver-side filter unit. The main advantage of this technology is the possibility to focus the field-of-view of the receiver on a specific light source and thereby suppress interference. Interference by ambient light, modulated interference and multi-aperture interference are introduced and signal-to-interference ratio improvements are derived using experimental results for a given LCD characteristic. By deriving the bit error rate for MIMO communications, the potential of the proposed interference reduction method is demonstrated.},

The VLC systems have a wide light spectrum, which provides a high data rate and low Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). One of the major issues in VLC systems is interference which is caused by daylight and other illumination sources. The other issue in VLC systems is that the transmission side provides data as complex values which causes transmission related issues and is hard to read at the receiver side due to a lot of channel noise. To solve these issues, we propose the hybrid approach of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The CDMA is employed for multiplexing the multi-user data for transmission to accommodate a large number of users and avoid inter-user interference. The line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLoS) components of the optical channel are simulated in MATLAB. Finally, the system is also designed physically using NI modules for the real-time environment.

The visible-light external modulator usually has limited modulation bandwidth. By using the predistortion, the upstream remodulated data rate is enhanced by ∼2.8 times. Hence, the VCSEL-based VLC system with 10.64-Gb/s downstream signal and 5-Mb/s upstream remodulated signal can be achieved.

Also, the number of events with peak flux density >103 SFU varies, as expected, with the solar cycle in the bands investigated (1-2, 2-4, and 4-10 GHz).

On a global basis by far the most significant source is ELF/VLF radiation from lightning propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. This atmospheric "noise," originating essentially from lightning discharges, is the main source of interference for VLF/LF telecommunications. One of the statistical measures that is used to define the properties of low-frequency radio noise is the voltage deviation Vd, which is a measure of the impulsiveness of the noise that is widely used to characterize radio noise, particularly in the International Radio Consultative Committee reports. In this paper we present atmospheric noise statistics based on VLF measurements at different temporal resolution (from minutes to seasonal variations). For the first time we present analysis of the statistical parameters of Vd from continuous broadband VLF measurements for a period extending more than 1 year. Our analysis shows that the long-term observed Vd characteristics can be reasonably estimated as the sum of two Gaussians distribution functions, while the hourly and seasonal distributions of Vd values can be fitted using a single Gaussian distribution with different mean and variance values.

   abstract = {Systems for atmospheric research and wireless communication use the High Frequency (HF) radio spectrum. At these frequencies, typically up to 20 MHz, the ambient electromagnetic noise is stronger than the noise generated by the receiver itself, thereby limiting the sensitivity of the instruments. Especially in urban areas, the noise level is high. In remote rural environments, where artificial noise sources are absent, a much lower noise level is observed. It has been shown that this noise arrives via ionospheric propagation and consists of impulsive noise from lightning and a background component that resembles additive white Gaussian noise. To establish the absolute field strength of this background noise component, a direction- and polarization-agnostic antenna is realized by adding the power of two orthogonal antenna elements in the digital domain. To suppress radio signals arriving via ionospheric propagation—of which the spectral and temporal aspects are not known a priori—a novel adaptive filter is demonstrated that separates the background noise from the radio signals in the joint frequency-time domain. This method is demonstrated using measurements from a polarimetric experiment on 7 MHz in a remote rural area in Catalonia. The results are submitted to the International Telecommunication Union for the validation of ambient noise models.},

D. and Washington, D. C. Total radio path absorptionsare presented for tropospheric forward scatter communication links for distances of 100, 300 and 1000 miles. The total path absorptions were calculated by summing the absorption contributed by each portion of the atmosphere traversed by a radio ray passing from a 60 foot parabolic antenna resting on the ground to the scattering center and then to a similar receiving antenna. A correlation of total path absorption with the surface value of absolute humidity is developed, thus providing estimates of the range of absorption values in different geographic areas. Maps of average absolute humidity for the world are presented. Previous work on rain absorption is then combined with the present study to provide estimates of the radio power loss due to absorption expected to be exceeded 1 per cent of the time.},

   abstract = {Multipath interference can occur in ground-based radar data acquired with systems with a large antenna beam width in elevation in an upward looking geometry, where the observation area and the radar are separated by a reflective surface. Radiation reflected at this surface forms a coherent overlay with the direct image of the observation area and appears as a fringe-like pattern in the data. This deteriorates the phase and intensity data and therefore can pose a considerable disadvantage to many ground-based radar measurement campaigns. This poses a problem for physical parameter retrieval from backscatter intensity and polarimetric data, absolute and relative calibration on corner reflectors, the generation of digital elevation models from interferograms and in the case of a variable reflective surface, differential interferometry. The main parameters controlling the interference pattern are the vertical distance between the radar antennas and the reflective surface, and the reflectivity of this surface. We used datasets acquired in two different locations under changing conditions as well as a model to constrain and fully understand the phenomenon. To avoid data deterioration in test sites prone to multipath interference, we tested a shielding of the antennas preventing the radar waves from illuminating the reflective surface. In our experiment, this strongly reduced but did not completely prevent the interference. We therefore recommend avoiding measurement geometries prone to multipath interferences.},

   abstract = {The lack of reliable estimates of the reflection and diffraction coefficients of radio waves by urban structures is one of the main barriers to deterministic modeling of the UHF channel. In complex environments such as urban areas, the reception of multiple echoes of the transmitted signal generally prevents direct in situ measurements of these coefficients. For the present study, the contributions of the different paths to the measured received power were separated by coupling the channel impulse response sounding with the determination of the direction of arrival (DOA). From experimental data we were able to isolate the field component generated by reflection or diffraction on buildings by both delay and angle of incidence. We deduced the corresponding reflection and diffraction coefficients. The wave DOA was determined using a ring array. The angle of arrival patterns were extracted by two different methods, namely the Wiener inversion method and the beam-forming method. The coefficients deduced by these two techniques are shown to be very close. These results are also similar to those obtained without the help of DOA separation when delay resolution makes them available. We also show the validity of geometrical rays to represent reflection and diffraction of decimetric waves on the kind of building concerned.},

A three-dimensional (3D) stochastic approach, which is based on the statistical description of the terrain features, houses and vegetation, and deterministic description of signal decay is presented. The scattering and diffraction from trees and buildings, as well as the diffused reflection from the rough structures of the obstructions are modeled using the statistical description of an array of non-transparent phase screens randomly distributed on the rough terrain. The model, which accounts for single scattering and diffraction phenomena and a similar model, which accounts for multiple scattering effects without effects of diffraction are compared with measurements carried out in typical rural mixed residential areas with vegetation. The accuracy of the theoretical prediction is analyzed accounting possible variations of the terrain features. The approach presented here is applicable in many cases, where specific topographical information is not available.},

   abstract = {The enhanced proliferation of connected entities needs a deployment of innovative technologies for the next generation wireless networks. One of the critical concerns, however, is the spectrum scarcity, due to the unprecedented broadcast penetration rate nowadays. Based on this, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a viable solution to secure high-speed communications. VLC, a high data rate communication technology, has proven its stature as a promising complementary to its radio frequency (RF) counterpart. VLC is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and secure technology that exploits the current infrastructure, specifically within indoor and underwater environments. Yet, despite their appealing capabilities, VLC systems face several limitations which constraint their potentials such as LED’s limited bandwidth, dimming, flickering, line-of-sight (LOS) requirement, impact of harsh weather conditions, noise, interference, shadowing, transceiver alignment, signal decoding complexity, and mobility issue. Consequently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered an effective technique to circumvent these shortcomings. The NOMA scheme has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm to address the shortcomings of VLC systems. The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, system’s capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. Motivated by this, the presented study offers an overview of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article provides a broad scope of existing research activities of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and VLC and surveys several NOMA-enabled VLC systems. We briefly highlight the potential and capabilities of NOMA-based VLC systems. In addition, we outline the integration of such systems with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, we focus on NOMA-based hybrid RF/VLC networks and discuss the role of machine learning (ML) tools and physical layer security (PLS) in this domain. In addition, this study also highlights diverse and significant technical hindrances prevailing in NOMA-based VLC systems. We highlight future research directions, along with provided insights that are envisioned to be helpful towards the effective practical deployment of such systems. In a nutshell, this review highlights the existing and ongoing research activities for NOMA-based VLC systems, which will provide sufficient guidelines for research communities working in this domain and it will pave the way for successful deployment of these systems.},

VLC provides tremendous advantages compared to conventional radio frequency, such as a higher transmission rate, high bandwidth, low-power consumption, no health hazards, less interference, etc., which make it more prominent in recent days. Due to their outstanding features, including low cost, low power consumption, etc., µ-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have gained considerable attention for VLC implementation, but mostly for the ability to be used for lighting as well as communications. In this review paper, we will focus mainly on recent developments in VLC applications and various factors affecting the modulation bandwidth of VLC devices. Numerous factors, such as quantum confined stark effect (QCSE), carrier lifetime, carrier recombination time, crystal orientation, etc. affect the modulation bandwidth of LEDs, and more information will be discussed in the following sections. This paper will focus on VLC applications based on LEDs but mainly on semipolar µ-LEDs and µ-LED-based arrays with high bandwidths. Another important application of VLC is underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC), which has drawn a huge interest in marine exploration and underwater connectivity, but still faces some challenges because visible light is being used. In addition, this paper will focus on how the current VLC system modulation bandwidth can be enhanced. Many methods have been introduced, such as decreasing the active layer thickness or effective active area or using doping, but the bandwidth is restricted by the recombination time when the system configuration reaches its limit. Therefore, it is important to find alternative ways such as optimizing the system, using the blue filter or using the equalization technology, which will be addressed later. Overall, this review paper provides a brief overview of the VLC-based system performance and some of its potential prospects.},
